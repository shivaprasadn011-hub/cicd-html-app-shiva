# weather-forecast-app
🌦️For this demo, I’ve focused on implementing current weather data only, to demonstrate API integration and frontend/backend communication. Application built with Next.js (TypeScript) for the frontend and Laravel (API-only) for the backend. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, providing current conditions in a sleek and responsive UI using RippleUI + Tailwind CSS.
